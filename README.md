Credits to kkatano for the bakeneko keyboard

I would also want to thank Elaine for letting me use the backplate design

I modified the back of the case to be more thicker to fit the backplate well

Inspired by JoeCastr bakeneko which was taken down by himself

You can contact these people to manufacture the keyboard: https://www.instagram.com/gaojie.manufacturing.alva/, https://www.instagram.com/nash.prototype/ and https://www.instagram.com/wu.zamol/ if you are willing to pay the price of Al6063-T6 then i suggest you go with that for the case since it's what most endgame kb level use, if you want it to be budget level polycarbonate case or 6061 case

if you are in the USA i suggest Rikkachet#2267 on discord to manufacture the kb
