# backplate-bakeneko60
Backplate screw M3x4mm thread pitch is 0.5

Credits to kkatano for the bakeneko keyboard

I would also want to thank Elaine for letting me add the backplate design

I modified the back of the case to be more thicker to fit the backplate well

Inspired by JoeCastr bakeneko that is taken down by himself
